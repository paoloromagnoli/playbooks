# Paolo's ansible playbook
This is a personal collection of ansible playbooks that I am using for VMware Cloud Assembly labs, demos and proof of concepts. These playbooks are really dirty as they are the result of copy and paste from colleagues's playbooks adjusted to make them work for my use cases and in my environments.
